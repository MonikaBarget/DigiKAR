# Data structure in the Mainz work package

1) **Table design in EXCEL for collecting biographic data**

| factoid_ID | pers_ID | event_date | event_after-date | event_before-date | event_start | event_end | event_type | pers_name | pers_title | pers_function | place_name | inst_name | rel_pers | alternative_names | source_quotations | additional_info | comment | source | source_site | info_dump |
|------------|---------|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|

2) **Structure of tables for the different data sources**

a) "Erfurt" data (2022-11-11, last updated on February 2nd, 2023):

- factoid_ID	
- IsSubject	
- Reise (sic!)
- pers_ID	
- pers_name	
- alternative_names	
- event_after-date	
- event_before-date	
- event_start	
- event_end	
- event_date	
- pers_title	
- pers_function	
- place_name	
- inst_name	
- rel_pers	
- source_quotations	
- additional_info	
- comment	source	
- source_site	
- info_dump	
- Weitere Belegstellen (column not in initial data model)
- StaatskalenderID (column not in initial data model)
- Import-ID (column not in initial data model)

**5987 rows of data!**

**Not all persons in this data set have been documented!**

**2081 rows of data!**

This spreadsheet has an additional tab with REL_PERS information to be included in final person list. However, this list is not yet complete.

c) **1756er Staatskalender META FINAL** (last updated January 27th, 2023):

This spreadsheet contains 5 tabs of biographic data. In some of the tabs, the "inst_name" column is named "H".
This has been changed in the copy for data consolidation.

The columns in this spreadsheet are:

- factoid_ID
- pers_ID
- alternative_names	
- event_start	
- pers_title		
- pers_function	
- place_name		
- inst_name (or "H"?)	
- source	
- pers_name_org (not in original data model!)
- pers_name	
- source_quotations	
- comment	
- source_site	
- Hilfsspalte (not in original data model!)
- additional_info	
- Recherchehinweise	(not in original data model!)
- ID_Factoid-List (not in original data model!)

*Overview of the individual tabs in the Staatskalender spreadsheet:*

- FS0 = 4457 entries
- FS1 = 4910 entries
- FS2 = 5051 entries
- FS3 = 6602 entries
- FS4 = 6540 entries

Due to the large number of data rows per sheet and the redundant nature of the entries (functions enumerated per year), a vertical consolidation should be performed prior to a horizontal mapping of entities.

*Important information to add to consolidated Staatskalender files:*

- add exact name of data source
- add missing person IDs (based on all existing person data)
- carefully analyse cases where middle names might be missing (issue of person disambiguation)
- watch out for entities that are currently NOT captured in the ontology lists (links below)

The 1755 Staatskalender data will not be used in the current project phased.

d) Professors' and students' biographies based on Gutenberg API and Universit√§tsmatrikel (OCR):

The data structure matches the initially defined model. API and OCR data combined, there are **9013 rows of entries**.
After the reconstruction of additional events, 2412 rows were added. This combined dataframe has **11428 entries**.

The merging of duplicate events reduces that number to **9323**.

3) **Ontology tables**

For an overview of named entities in the Mainz work package and our data mapping, cf. the [ontology lists](https://github.com/ieg-dhr/DigiKAR/tree/main/OntologyFiles).

4) **Data queries**

- Which offices were often held in succession?
- What are typical careers of people from place X or educated in place Y?
- What is the ratio / distribution of clerical and temporal offices?
- Which persons where involved in research, teaching, political activities etc.?
- What are spatial hotspots of activity?
- Can we already say something about institutional or familial networks?

5) **Challenges and limitations**

- A more thorough analysis of the Staatskalender would require a full digital edition with annotations.
