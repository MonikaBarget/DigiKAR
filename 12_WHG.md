The World Historical Gazetteer welcomes the contribution of new spatial data in two formats. While one format is ideal for smaller projects and less complex data,
the more detailed JSON-based Linked Places-Format allows the modelling of different ["relations"](﻿https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places-format)﻿ between places.

The complete documentation is available on GitHub: LinkedPasts/linked-places-format 

"Linked Places format is used to describe attestations of places in a standard way, primarily for linking gazetteer datasets. (...) A set (list) of one or more attestations.
The *relationType* property must be de-referenceable to an existing vocabulary or ontology. 
E.g., in the Getty Vocabulary Ontology, *broaderPartitive* relations are used to represent 'parents' in an administrative hierarchy; 
*tgn3317_member_of* and *tgn3318_member_is* relations can be used to represent political unions, empires, and regions."

To add: information on integrating our DigiKAR ontology, including political and religious affiliations of places.
