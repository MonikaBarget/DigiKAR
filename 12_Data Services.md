# Data services for (historical) geodata

<p align="justify">This page presents a few German and international services that provide and / or accept (historical) geodata and can be useful for making project data more accessible and interoperable.

# World Historical Gazetteer (WHG)

<p align="justify">The World Historical Gazetteer welcomes the contribution of new spatial data in two formats. While one format is ideal for smaller projects and less complex data,
the more detailed JSON-based <em>Linked Places-Format</em> allows the modelling of different <a href="﻿https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places-format">"relations"</a>﻿ between places. Both formats are used to describe attestations of places in a standard way, primarily for linking gazetteer datasets. 
The <code>relationType</code> property must be de-referenceable to an existing vocabulary or ontology. E.g., in the Getty Vocabulary Ontology, <code>broaderPartitive</code> relations are used to represent item parents in an administrative hierarchy. <code>tgn3317_member_of</code> and <code>tgn3318_member_is</code> relations can be used to represent political unions, empires, and regions.</p>

# GOV

<p align="justify">The <a href="http://www.gov.genealogy.net/search/index">Historic Gazetteer GOV</a> (Geschichtliches Ortsverzeichnis), contributes to the exact identification of places, a critical aspect of genealogy and historical research. Unfortunately, not all researchers and history enthusiasts can devote time to this complicated process, which is why the GOV project was established, with the primary objective of assisting historians and genealogists in effectively managing place references while providing them with up-to-date resources. Over time, GOV aspires to offer a comprehensive resource with unified access to diverse location-based information. This includes geographical coordinates or map positioning of a place, various properties associated with a place (e.g. postal codes and town codes), historical data on foreign or former place names, and past affiliations (whether administrative, legal, or related to religious institutions). GOV's extensive database encompasses a wide range of entities, including churches, church districts, towns, districts, regions, and more, all internally referred to as "GOV objects." As of November 2014, GOV had cataloged approximately one million entries.</p>
