<h1>Data visualisation in DigiKAR</h1>

<h2>Goals and challenges</h2>
<p align="justify">
The <a href="https://digikar.eu/">DigiKAR geo-humanities project</a> (<strong>Digital Map Lap Holy Roman Empire</strong>) is an interdisciplinary and international project led by the Institute of European History in Mainz and funded by the German Leibniz Association from 2021 to 2024. It questions established visual representations of a historical space whose legal and political complexity is only insufficiently captured through polygons and line-oriented maps with narrow thematic foci. As a fractured yet interwoven territory, the Holy Roman Empire and its individual, often overlapping or contested regions require multi-modal and multi-perspective visualizations. By proto-typically tracing human, material, and ideational border-crossings and competing spatial conceptions, the project addresses the central challenges of both traditional imperial historiography and digital historical research.
</p>

<h3>One primary focus of DigiKAR is to understand data visualisations as both explorational and educational tools. Our approach to (geo)visualisations is marked by the following four statements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visualisations (in the plural), not ONE visualisation!</li>
<li>Visualisations not at the end of a project, but throughout!</li>
<li>Visualisations not only by "experts," but also by students!</li>
<li>Visualisations on various levels of complexity!</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
Bringing together interdisciplinary researchers as well as heritage professionals and students, the DigiKAR project uses maps for high-level data evaluation, data cleaning, a critical reflection on our own research biases, and as tools to highlight developments and alternative views of our data. At a later stage, more elaborate visualizations as tools of science communication will follow.

The image gives an example of a static map created for DigiKAR: In this map, lines are connecting early modern migrants' places of birth with places where birth or apprenticeship letters were issued. These letters are the early modern versions of passports and other certificates. The spatial data behind this map came from early modern manuscript records kept at the City Archives in Mainz, Germany.

Some metadata had already been digitized, other data were collected by a team of MA students who transcribed letters from scratch. The visualization displayed here was created by MA student Maximilian Michel and helped us understand the often impressive distances across which early modern agents would relocate for private or professional reasons.

<h3>Visualisation as storytelling</h3>

<p align="justify">
Overall, we view visualizations as a storytelling device on two levels.
On the one hand, maps help us to tell history from different perspectives and to make "gaps" and ambiguities visible.
On the other hand, visualizations tell the story of our research process and make (changing) research questions transparent.

The slide on the left gives an example of the narrative embedding of visualizations in our project.
The DigiKAR pilot project "<a href="https://teaching-dhlab.pages.gitlab.rlp.net/geburtsbriefemainz/home/">Early modern birth letters from Mainz</a>", which we completed in August 2021, combines a digital edition of multi-lingual text sources, different maps, and academic content. A second mapping experiment, carried out with MA students of history in 2022, covers the <a href="https://clerical-mobility.ieg-mainz.de/">professional biographies of high-ranking clerics in the Prince-Archbishopric of Mainz</a>.
