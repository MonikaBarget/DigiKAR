- What is the ratio / distribution of clerical and temporal offices?
- Which persons were involved in research, teaching, political activities etc.?
- What are spatial hotspots of activity?
- Can we already say something about institutional or familial networks?
- In how far do our findings contradict or confirm existing qualitative research?
