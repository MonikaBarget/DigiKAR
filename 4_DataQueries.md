# Data Queries

Data queries in DigiKAR are inherently driven by historical research questions specific to our two work packages. Based on user stories and a thorough requirements analysis conducted by work package 4 "Data Modelling", Ingo Frank (IOS Regensburg) has developed sample SPARQL queries that reflect some of our research goals. A complete German-language documentation of our competency questions and user stories is available in <a href="https://ieg-dhr.github.io/DigiKAR-Competency-Questions/">a separate Github repository</a>.

In work package 3, which has a focus on biographies and human mobility, we are, inter alia, interested in the following aspects of our data:

- Which offices were often held in succession?
- What are the typical careers of people from place X or educated in place Y?
- What is the ratio / distribution of clerical and temporal offices?
- Which persons were involved in research, teaching, political activities etc.?
- What are spatial hotspots of activity?
- Can we already say something about institutional or familial networks?
- In how far do our findings contradict or confirm existing qualitative research?

In the summer term of 2022, Bettina Braun (JGU Mainz) taught an <a href="http://clerical-mobility.ieg-mainz.de/">MA seminar in the history programme</a>, which focused on fourteen early modern cathedral provosts from Mainz. Their professional careers and mobility patterns already gave us essential insights into Mainz's religious and political interconnections in the 17th and 18th centuries. Several clerics in the data set studied abroad, went on the grand tour or took on diplomatic missions. Moreover, many clerics serving in the Mainz cathedral chapters also served in Speyer or Cologne at some point in their careers. One example of a mobile cleric in the analysed data set is Dietrich Kaspar von FÃ¼rstenberg, who spent time in Florence and Rome as well as in Speyer, Cologne, Bohemia and several places in present-day Belgium and France. Results from the seminar included static maps and a <a href="http://clerical-mobility.ieg-mainz.de/qgis2web_Domherren_v3/#4/51.08/2.07">zoomable map of individual biographies</a>.

**Challenges and limitations**

A more thorough analysis of the Staatskalender would require a complete digital edition with annotations.
