# Managing space

:::info
This part of the documentation is still missing. It should give a brief summary of how we manage the concept of space in the DigiKAR project.
:::

## Places as virtual / relational spaces

Many places in AP3 denote connections that are not necessarily physical, see places of nobilitation. Many offices and titles awarded in the early modern period could be held by absent persons.

## Differentiating between places and territories

Some sources contain research speculations on which places within a country or region a person visited, e.g. "Ã–sterreich / Wien". Other regions which people visited are cultural regions whose borders or extensions can hardly be defined, e.g. "Wetterau" / "Wetteraviensis".

## Problems relating Latin and Latinised descriptions of origin to actual places

## Challenges resulting from anachronistic place names used in sources or older research literature

## Dealing with spatial uncertainty in DigiKAR
