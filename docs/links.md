# Links

Links to DigiKAR output such as conference papers and publications, a Zotero library, and blogposts on work in progress.

## Conference papers and publications

:::info

Short overview of the events in which we have participated and what the focus was. If we can directly link a relevant folder in the public Zotero library, we should also do that here. But I would also export a bibliography of the talks and publications to add directly to this page.

## Zotero library

::: info

The DigiKAR team has created a [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library in which we share our own project publications as well as related projects and the metadata of sources we have used for the project. This library will be made public after the funding period.

## Ontology design patterns

Traditional modeling of geospatial data limits the possibilities to integrate, distribute, retrieve, and reuse the data. The Linked Data paradigm enables new
ways to tackle these issues. Thus, we follow a Linked Data approach towards modeling geospatial information extracted from different historical sources.

## Best practice visualizations

This working paper combines the Best Practice Visualisations (BPV) that depict historical, cultural, and environmental data in various forms, such as maps, graphs, and databases.
The BPV has been compiled, analysed, and evaluated for the visualisation purposes of the project DigiKAR.
It aims to gain an in-depth overview of existing projects by evaluating the selected spatial visualisations.

## Prototype

The prototype for visualizations on mobility and rights and right holders in the Holy Roman Empire is work in progress and frequently updated.
