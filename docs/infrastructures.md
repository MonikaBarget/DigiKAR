## Limitations of technical development in small projects

In contrast to projects that are financed as long-term research from fixed budgets or repeatedly receive national funding, 
DigiKAR was a small and fixed-term project from the start. 
That is why the image of a "digital humanities iceberg" can illustrate how large the proportion of strenuous and often
barely visible preparatory work is in most digital projects. 
The development of user portals for data exploration or the creation of interactive visualizations represent only the tip 
of the iceberg in the field of digital humanities. A large part of the work consists of the often manual data collection, 
data cleansing and data normalization, which can take years depending on the source situation and the state of research. 
However, this invisible work is crucial for the quality and usability of the data, which is ultimately presented in 
repositories or on publicly accessible websites.

## Challenges in data sharing

We face several challenges in data sharing. One of the biggest challenges is that research institutions often do not 
provide sustainable infrastructures for the development and use of digital applications. After the end of a project, 
digital applications are often only archived, and further use of the raw data requires special prior knowledge. 
In addition, despite the use of standardized formats such as JSON, the data is often difficult to link, as import 
templates do not always contain all the necessary details or form categories that are too general 
(see DigiKAR discussions regarding WHG Linked Places and Linked Traces). Documenting the data takes a lot of time and is 
often inadequate, which makes it difficult to reuse the data. In addition, digital services are often only aimed at a 
specific group of researchers and are not generally comprehensible. Finally, working with different data sources raises 
rights issues and can prevent publication according to open science criteria.

## Opportunities through the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)

The National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI), in which the IEG Mainz is participating as part of the humanities consortium NDFI4Memory, will hopefully offer new opportunities by creating a demand-oriented, integrating and service-based infrastructure. This should enable a coherent data space for the community and create incentives for data publications, which have so far hardly been recognized and therefore neglected. NDF4Memory also aims to contribute to the development of common data standards in the historical sciences. Existing data standards are often subject-specific or not widely applicable, which limits the interoperability of data. A service-based infrastructure can provide a remedy here and significantly improve the quality and usability of the data. I myself am very pleased that NFDI4Memory is working on a Jupyter Notebook infrastructure for the collaborative creation of code, for example.
