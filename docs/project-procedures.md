# Project procedures

## International cooperation in various disciplines

Our main goal in the interdisciplinary cooperation of several institutes is to achieve an equal multi-perspectivity,
which is characterised by the division of tasks according to expertise, but also by the joint development of methods.
We attach great importance to combining different research interests, as it is not only historians who have relevant research questions.
The collaboration with EHESS Paris and IfL Leipzig ensure that our work also reflects on the role of historical cartography and, above all,
to provide German historiography with new ideas on the use of maps as an instrument of knowledge.
The relevant German-language specialist literature on historical cartography mostly dates back to the 1960s and 1980s,
and historical maps that are still produced today in regional history do not take up new questions (e.g. from French research) or technical innovations.
Our concern to promote a modified, more complex representation of historical space also coincides with the information science questions of data modelling
that is as transparent as possible and also makes gaps and uncertainties clear, which were posed in the DigiKAR project, above all by Ingo Frank.

Transcending disciplinary boundaries, our aim is not to project spatial expectations of modern nation states onto the early modern past, but to
highlight the peculiarities of biographical mobility or plural rights of rule in the Holy Roman Empire.

## Experimental and explorative approaches

Our approach is strongly experimental, explorative and iterative. We work with a wide range of data sources, including prints,
manuscripts and secondary research collections. This data is available in various formats, such as SQL dumps, XML, CSV and JSON.
We use a semi-manual method for data cleansing, which includes both Open Refine and Python scripts. Different ways of analysing, including SPARQL,
SQL and Python, are tried out to achieve the best possible results.
