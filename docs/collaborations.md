# Collaborations

## Collaborations as an important aspect of the DigiKAR Project

Extended collaborations are an important part of our work. Over the past three years, we have worked closely with
students in internships and project seminars and exchanged data and expertise with archives and libraries. We also
cooperate with state historical offices and other map projects. There has been a particularly intensive exchange with
colleagues from Bavaria, who are working on the historical atlas of Franconia, and with colleagues who are working on
a nationwide historical atlas in Poland. This collaboration enables us to improve and scrutinize our own work.

## New project ideas

We will continue to work on the collected data and its visualization until the end of 2024. The focus will be on several
topics. On the one hand, we are planning to integrate individual data collections into follow-up projects with new
historical questions. Secondly, we would like to advise external researchers on the subsequent use of our data. Another
goal is to use DigiKAR data as examples in methodologically oriented new projects. One example of this is the
attempt by myself, Monika Barget, to organize an international hackathon on data preparation with Large Language Models (LLMs)
based on DigiKAR data.

## What we learn from DigiKAR

but we also hope that we can show potential and inspire historical research in general. Through our experimental and
What we learn from DigiKAR

Overall, the DigiKAR project certainly shows how difficult it still is to combine historical data and digital methods,
but we also hope that we can show potential and inspire historical research in general.
Through our experimental and exploratory approaches, the collaboration with different partners and the use of a wide
range of data sources and formats, we were able to gain important
insights into the modelling and visualization of historical data, which we would like to share and discuss.
