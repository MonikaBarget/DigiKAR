# The DigiKAR project
## From “patchwork quilt” to multiple multipolar networks
In the past, the Holy Roman Empire has often been described in its supposed imperfection as a "patchwork quilt". The proverbial colorful picture of a collection of the most diverse territories in the common historical maps, thanks to corresponding color accentuation, is likely to have shaped the image of the Holy Roman Empire for generations. Central features of this polygonal - i.e. based on clearly delineated areas and lines - conception of space are security and unambiguity of boundaries: For each point on such a map, the question of belonging can be decided with certainty and unambiguity. "Inside" and "outside" are undoubtedly graspable.

The historical reality, however, was different: even more colorful, even more confusing, even more complex than the talk of a "patchwork quilt" already suggests, at least to modern observers. In fact, the closed territorial state - in the language of the time, the _territorium clausum_ - is to be understood merely as one form of spatial construction among many; and as one that takes particular account of the perspective of authority. It is not without reason that recent research warns against (over-)interpreting historical maps as a reflection of historical realities and instead points to their function of claiming and enforcing (just not yet undoubtedly enforced) claims of possession.

Of course, modern historiography has attempted to adequately depict these uncertainties and ambiguities of claims of possession, for example in the form of appropriate legends, color accentuation, hatchings in printed maps, etc. As a geohumanities project, DigiKAR aims to take this path further and, using both technological and conceptual resources provided by modern information sciences, develop innovative and connectable concepts of representing plurality and competition of spaces beyond the traditional map-based representation. Fundamental to this is a move away from a polygonal in favor of a place-based understanding of space. In the Digital Map Workshop, spaces are understood as social constructs that are (were) decisively based on places that can be localized in a coordinate system and to which heterogeneous, divergent rights, claims and affiliations, etc. could be attached. In this way, territorial interconnections and the lack of clarity as well as fluid border courses can be rendered visible and made accessible as models for research questions of (early modern) spatial history.

However, it is not only the all too often competing and disputed claims to power that make the unambiguousness of the polygonal representation appear questionable. In addition to the area, which was primarily conceived in the categories of sovereignty and rule, there were many other different legal, social, jurisdictional, confessional, economic, fiscal, etc. ties. These constituted their own, partly overlapping, competing spaces at different levels of action. Unambiguous demarcations fade in the glaring glow of historical reality. Despite the process of territorialization - understood as an imperfect basic tendency - which cannot be negated, this finding also applies to the late phase of the Holy Roman Empire (and probably beyond; think, for example, of the Crimea or global financial flows, "digital nomads," etc.). In the early modern empire, different borders and spaces coexisted, spanning as multipolar networks between different places.

In its analysis and visualization, however, DigiKAR aims to go beyond the creation of digital maps. In order to map the complex spatial structures as well as trans- and inter-territorial practices at different levels of action - local, regional, territorial, and imperial - network diagrams and other non-cartographic forms of representation of spatio-temporal relations are sought in addition to digital maps.

## Working in the lab: iterative & experimental
In the Digital Map Lab, geographers, historians and information scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography Leipzig (IfL), the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies Regensburg (IOS), the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales Paris (EHESS) are working closely together under the leadership of the Leibniz Institute for European History Mainz (IEG).

Two differently oriented case studies on the electorates of Mainz and Saxony form the core of the project. In an experimental and iterative process, site-specific historical data from different sources are collected and scientific subject-specific requirements are formulated. This represents the starting point for both ontology-based data modeling and experimental evaluation and analysis in various forms of representation. The procedure for data modeling is based on the "eXtreme Design methodology" and is to be explicitly thought of as an iterative process in which the data model is continuously extended, refined and corrected in the light of new data. CIDOC-CRM and CRMgeo serve as the starting point for the development of a cross-project data model that is also compatible with other projects. The latter makes it possible, for example, to record locations whose spatial extent cannot be determined exactly. Conversely, the models are used in data acquisition as the experimentally developed forms of representation are also used in the historiographic research process. DigiKAR understands the latter not only as a means of presenting and illustrating research results, but also explicitly as tools in the research process that open up new perspectives on what is supposedly known and raise (entirely) new questions.

## Putting it to the test: case studies on Electoral Mainz and Electoral Saxony

The data basis for DigiKAR is provided by two differently oriented historical case studies on the electorates of Mainz and Saxony. What they have in common is that they understand movements of people, things, and ideas not only as physical mobility potentials in complex spaces, but also fathom them in terms of their affiliation with different, sometimes competing social, legal, and ruling spaces of the imperial federation. Moreover, both case studies evoke questions about how to deal with a heterogeneous, inconsistent, incomplete, and sometimes contradictory database.
