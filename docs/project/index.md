# The DigiKAR Project

This documentation gives an insight into data and data queries in the DigiKAR Geohumanities project (2021-2024). The work package "Electoral Saxony" focuses on spatial structuring via rulers' rights, while the work package "Electoral Mainz" records the mobility of officials via biographical events. Explanations of the data structure and the research questions are documented exclusively in English, the short descriptions of the scripts and their use cases are available in German, English and French. In addition to the short descriptions, blogposts and videos (German and/or English) explaining the processes are linked.
