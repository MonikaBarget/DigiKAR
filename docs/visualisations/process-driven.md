# Process-driven

Experiments can go wrong.
At the DigiKAR project we tried to embrace this and tried to learn as much as possible from the mistakes we made throughtout the project.
With the help of documentation and user tests, we tried get better each time, when creating visualizations for DigiKAR.

## Processes

- video-recording of a workshop
- iterative process (users, research questions, visualizations)
- sketching
- prototyping

## User studies

- on the perceptual level
- on the usability level
