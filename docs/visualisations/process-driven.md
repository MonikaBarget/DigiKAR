Experiments can go wrong.
At the DigiKAR project we tried to embrace this and tried to learn as much as possible from the mistakes we made throughtout the project.
With the help of documentation and user tests, we tried get better each time, when creating visualizations for DigiKAR.

## How to implement an experimental approach?

For the DigiKAR project we used the following methods:

- documenting (e.g. video-recordings of a workshop, version control)
- iterative process (users, research questions, visualizations)
- sketching
- prototyping

## User studies

- on the perceptual level
- on the usability level
