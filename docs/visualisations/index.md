# Visualisation Principles

## 🧪 Experimental Approach

DigiKAR was planned and executed as a laboratory, hence with a strong experimental character.
Read [more](experimental-approach) on why we decided to do so and what the main challenges this approach entailed.

## 🪴 Process driven

Experiments can go wrong.
At the DigiKar project we tried to embrace this and tried to learn as much as possible from the mistakes we made throughtout the project.
Read [more](process-driven) on how we tried get better each time, by e.g. documentation and user tests, when creating visualizations for DigiKAR.

## 🧑‍💻 Technology

For DigiKAR as [DH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) project digital data and tools to process them are essential.
As more and more technologies are adapoted by digital humanities, workflows are diversified and required a variety of sometimes quite for complex tech stacks.
We aim for a minimal setup to get involved in the DigiKAR project.
