# Experimental Approach

DigiKAR was planned and executed as a laboratory, hence with a strong experimental character.

## Why an experimental approach?

Certainly, it is nice to have a finished product, but the process of getting there is equally important.
As clichee as it sounds – we wanted to enjoy the process and take out as much as possible.We believe that when creating visualizations we usually spend a lot of time on details, which are important for the finished product, but very time consuming.
With an experimental approach we wanted to give ourselves the freedom and – first of all – the time to try things out.
Always with the possibility of failing.

The experimental approach allows us to learn from our mistakes and to improve our methods and tools. It also allows us to be more flexible and to adapt to new insights and requirements along the way.

## Keeping the target group in mind

- DH professionals (digital data processing skills assumed), but also historians (not necessarily with a digital background)

## The challenge

Accepting imperfections and uncertainty.
