# Technology

## Based on opensource technologies

Allowing others to reuse or extend our project:
like we benefited from great open-source libraries we want others to be able to do the same with our solutions.

## Targeting the web

Instead of creating a desktop application, we decided to create a web-based tool.
This allows us to reach a broader audience:

- no setup required (no installation)
- it is crossplatform (does not require specific operating systems or hardware)

## Accessibility first

:::info
This part of the documentation is still missing. Potential topics to cover:

- technologies, web-based tools
  - for historians
  - why a web tool in the end? (why not create something based on QGIS), because we can be more creative / more flexible?
