# Technology

## Based on opensource technologies

Allowing others to reuse or extend our project:
like we benefited from great open-source libraries we want others to be able to do the same with our solutions.

## Targeting the web

Instead of creating a desktop application, we decided to create a web-based tool.
This allows us to reach a broader audience:

- no setup (does only require a modern browser and internet connection)
- it is crossplatform (does not require specific operating systems or hardware)

## APIs for data access

Both working packages, expose the collected and normalized data vian an API.
We see the access to data via an API as another step towards accessible and reusable results of the DigiKAR project.
The [prototype](https://digikar.geohistoricaldata.org) uses this API as well.

## Accessibility first

> [!Info]
> This part of the documentation is still missing. Potential topics to cover:
>
> - why a web tool in the end? (why not create visualizations e.g. in QGIS)?
>   - because we don't want users to install QGIS first
>   - because we want users to be able to use the tool in a well-known environment (their browser)
>   - because we want users to be able to easily share their findings (via an link, instead of e.g. a QGIS file)
>   - because there mature web mapping libraries we can build for be more creative / more flexible?
